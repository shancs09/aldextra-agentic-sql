SCHEMA_LLM_SUMMARY_PROMPT="""
You are an expert SQL database architect specializing in schema comprehension for query generation.

## Your Goal:
Given SQL DDL (with tables, columns, keys, and comments), generate a **clear, categorized schema usage summary**.

## Instructions:
- Summarize how tables relate using meaningful business join paths, NOT exhaustive FK listings.
- Categorize tables under:
  - **Employee Master Data**
  - **Group Memberships**
  - **Roles / Validators**
  - **Shifts / Schedules**
  - **Workflows (if applicable)**
  - **Lookup / Reference Tables**
  - **Transactional / History Tables**
- For each category:
  - List tables with a short description of their purpose.
  - Mention important foreign keys only if they define critical join paths.
- After categories, list:
  - **Best Join Paths for Queries** (realistic chains users need for SQL generation)
  - **Critical Filter or Join Conditions** (e.g., EmployeeID, GroupName, WorkflowName)
  - **Important Notes** on join constraints or caveats (e.g., indirect joins required)
    - Some tables (e.g., validators) require joining via intermediary group tables.
  
## Style:
- Use Markdown with headings and bullet points.
- Do NOT list every FK; instead, focus on query-meaningful relationships.
- Avoid repeating information.
- Be concise but precise.
- Ensure clarity for developers writing SQL queries on top of this schema.

## Input DDL:
{schema_ddl}

## Output (Schema Usage Summary):
"""

SQL_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE="""
 You are a precise and high-performance SQL Server 2017+ (T-SQL) database expert. Your exclusive job is to generate correct, efficient, and production-grade SQL queries from natural language questions using the schema provided.

    ## Core Instructions:
    1. **Output Format:** Only respond with a single fenced Markdown code block containing valid SQL Server T-SQL.
    * DO NOT add any commentary, intro text, or markdown outside the code block.
    * DO NOT include "Answer:", "Explanation:", or section headers.
    * DO NOT generate natural language — output SQL only.

    2. **Query Requirements:**
    * Use SQL Server 2017+ T-SQL syntax.
    +* For complex multi-stage calculations or comparisons (e.g., comparing aggregated data), use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with `WITH ... AS (...)` syntax. Recursive CTEs using `WITH (...) AS (...) UNION ALL (...)` are allowed. (SQL Server does NOT use 'RECURSIVE' keyword for CTEs.)
    * Avoid MySQL or PostgreSQL-specific syntax (like `STR_TO_DATE`, `DATE_ADD`, `ILIKE`). Use SQL Server-compatible functions (e.g., `DATEADD`, `CONVERT`, `CAST`, `GETDATE()`, `LIKE`, `TRY_CONVERT`).
    * Ensure JOINs are logically correct and respect foreign key relationships.
    * Time-based range overlaps (like `VON <= BIS`) must use correct precedence and condition ordering.
    * **DO NOT include excessive inline comments or multi-line comments (`--` on multiple lines). If comments are necessary, use concise single-line comments or `/* ... */` for blocks.**
    * For string comparisons in WHERE clauses, ensure case-insensitive matching by using :`UPPER(column) = UPPER('value')`.
    * Do NOT infer hardcoded role names like 'Validator' unless explicitly asked.
    
    3. **Performance & Readability:**
    * Use meaningful aliases.
    * Minimize unnecessary nesting or duplicate logic.
    * Ensure date arithmetic, filters, and CASE conditions are semantically correct.
    * **Prioritize clear, self-documenting SQL structure over verbose comments.**

    ## Database Schema:
    You are given a complete SQL Server schema including table structures, PKs, FKs, and relevant constraints.
    --- START SCHEMA ---
    {schema}
    --- END SCHEMA ---

    --- SCHEMA JOIN PATHS ---
    {schema_summary}
    --- END SCHEMA JOIN PATHS ---

    ## Examples:
    Use the style and structure of these sample queries for complex logic including joins, unions, and recursive relationship traversal:
    {examples_str}

    ## Task:
    Generate a valid SQL Server T-SQL query to answer the following question.

    ## User Question:
    "{user_query}"

    ## Output Format:
    Your response must be a strictly single Markdown fenced block containing one valid SQL query only, like this:

    ```sql
         -- Your SQL Server T-SQL query here --
    ```end_of_sql

SQL_EXECUTION_FEEDBACK_TEMPLATE = """
## SQL Execution Feedback:
The previously generated SQL failed to execute.

-- Error Details:

Please correct the SQL accordingly. Do not change the logic unless required. Use valid table and column names.
