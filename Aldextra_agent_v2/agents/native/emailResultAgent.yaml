instructions: "When the user requests to send results via email:\n\n  1. Prompt the\
  \ user to provide a valid email address if not already specified.\n\n  2. Once the\
  \ email address is available, invoke the `send_email_handler_send_email_post` tool\n\
  \     with the necessary payload (e.g., report path, email ID, subject if needed).\n\
  \n  3. Capture the response from the email service. The API response will contain:\n\
  \      - `status`: \"OK\" or \"ERROR\"\n      - `message`: a human-readable confirmation\
  \ or error message\n\n  4. Respond to the user with a Markdown-friendly message:\n\
  \      - If `status` is \"OK\", confirm that the email has been successfully sent.\n\
  \      - If `status` is \"ERROR\", inform the user politely and include the error\
  \ message.\n\n  5. Do **not** expose internal details such as tool names, backend\
  \ structure, or raw payloads unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n  6. Ensure\
  \ the final message is concise, polite, and clearly confirms the outcome of the\
  \ email-sending action.\n"
